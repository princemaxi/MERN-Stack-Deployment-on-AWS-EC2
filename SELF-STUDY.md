## What Is a Database
A database is a systematically organized collection of data stored electronically, designed to make it easier to store, access, manage and analyze information, including words, numbers, images, videos, and files.

Types of databases include relational databases, NoSQL databases, object-oriented databases, and graph databases. Relational databases use structured tables, while NoSQL supports unstructured data. Object-oriented databases store data as objects, and graph databases manage relationships using nodes and edges.

A “database” can also refer to a set of connected data accessed through a Database Management System (DBMS), which is a software that allows users to interact with one or more databases.
Because of the close relationship between them, the term “database” is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it.

## Database vs. Database Management System (DBMS)
A Database and a Database Management System (DBMS) are closely related terms, but they serve different purposes:

A database is a structured set of data. The data can be structured or unstructured and stored in various formats like tables, documents, and key-value pairs. It could be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amount of information in a corporate network.

A DBMS (Database Management System) is software used to interact with a database. It provides an interface for users or applications to manipulate data, making the handling of large amounts of data more efficient and less error-prone. A DBMS oversees core administrative tasks such as data storage, retrieval, security, concurrency control, backup and recovery, and query processing. Examples include Oracle Database, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and MongoDB.

In simpler terms, a database is like a container that holds the information, while a DBMS is a tool used to organize and manage the contents within that container.

To make things a little bit more complicated, the term “database” is often used informally to denote the DBMS, the database system, or even an application connected to the database.

## Understanding Database Structure 
A database structure simply refers to how data is organized within a database. Here are the key components:

- Tables: The fundamental blocks of a database structure are the tables, which consist of rows and columns.

- Rows and columns: A crucial aspect of the database structure is the rows and columns. Rows show independent columns, whereas columns show attributes of those records.

- Primary key: A unique identifier for each record in a table.

- Foreign key: A column that highlights a relationship between tables by referring to a primary key in another table.

This structure ensures proper storage, management, and retrieval of your data, resulting in smoother business operations.

## Introduction to Database Types
Databases can be classified into two primary types: Relational and NoSQL Databases. NoSQL is then further divided into four types: Document-oriented, Key-Value, Wide-Column, and Graph databases.


| Attribute       | Relational Databases                                  | NoSQL Databases                                           |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Structure  | Structured, tabular schema, fixed data types.        | Schema-less, accommodates a variety of data types.       |
| Scalability     | Typically scaled vertically (more CPU, RAM, SSD).    | Designed for horizontal scaling (more servers).          |
| Flexibility     | Limited flexibility.                                 | High flexibility.                                        |
| ACID Properties | Adhere to ACID properties for reliable transactions. | Some sacrifice ACID compliance for performance/scalability. |
| Use Cases       | Financial systems, CRM, e-commerce applications.     | Social media, IoT, real-time analytics, big data apps.   |

It’s worth noting that some databases, like MongoDB, can fall into multiple categories as they support different data models. Additionally, the list provided is not exhaustive, as there are many other databases available in each category.
Let’s take a deeper look into each database type, exploring its unique characteristics, real-world applications, and practical considerations.

## What are the different types of databases?
The main types of databases include hierarchical, network, object-oriented, relational, and NoSQL databases. Each type is designed for specific use cases, from managing structured data to handling large-scale, unstructured data.

### Hierarchical Database: 
Arranges data in a tree structure with parent-child relationships, making it ideal for use in scenarios where there are clear hierarchies, like organizational models, file systems, or hierarchical workflows.

### Network Database: 
Uses a graph-like structure to represent many-to-many relationships, often deployed in more complex environments that require multiple tangent points, like social networks or complex data systems like airline reservation platforms.

###  Object-Oriented Database: 
Stores data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming, and is ideal for applications with complex data models, such as multimedia or financial systems.

### Relational Database: 
Structures data in tables with rows and columns, adhering to ACID properties for reliable transactions. Commonly used in applications like CRM, financial systems, and e-commerce.

### NoSQL Database: 
Offers flexible, schema-less structures for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples include document-oriented, key-value, wide-column, and graph databases, often used in big data and real-time applications.

Generally, databases are broadly categorized into relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) systems, with organizations often choosing one or combining both, based on their data and operational needs.

### Relational Databases (also known as SQL Databases)
A relational database (RDB) is a method of organizing data into tables, rows, and columns to show relationships between data points. This structure makes it straightforward to access, create, read, modify, and delete data using a querying language—such as SQL.

Each table, also known as a relation, has rows (records) and columns (fields), where each row represents an entity, and each column represents an attribute of that entity.

You can establish relationships between entities through primary and foreign keys by guaranteeing data integrity and enabling complex queries.

### Strengths of Relational Databases:
1. The structured, table-like schema is easy to understand.

2.  Follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties which makes them reliable.

3. SQL language is standardized, widely used, and applicable to a variety of database management systems.

### Weaknesses of Relational Databases:
1. Can be difficult to scale out on multiple servers (horizontal scaling).

2. Each table requires a predefined schema which means all data inserted into the table must follow the same structure. This is not optimal when dealing with complex data structures.

### Common Use Cases:
1. Widely used in the financial industry thanks to the ACID properties that ensure data reliability in financial transactions and support complex financial analysis.

2. In healthcare, relational databases are used to manage structured data such as patient records, medical histories, and test results, aiding healthcare workflows.

3. Used to manage structured data such as customer, order, product, and payment data in e-commerce.

### NoSQL(Non-Relational) Databases
NoSQL databases were developed as an alternative to traditional SQL databases, NoSQL databases are especially useful when working with large or fast-moving data that may not fit neatly into a table.

NoSQL databases use various data models for accessing and managing data. These databases are optimized for applications needing flexible data models, handling large volumes of data, and achieving low latency.

They accomplish this by relaxing some of the data consistency restrictions found in relational databases, making them ideal for dynamic, high-performance applications that require scalability and speed.

Instead of tables, NoSQL databases use more flexible data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. They offer scalability and flexibility, making them suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples include MongoDB, CouchBase, Cassandra, and Redis.

### Strengths of NoSQL Databases:
1. Flexible and scalable, ideal for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.

2. Scale horizontally across multiple servers, making them highly scalable and fault-tolerant.
Well-suited for use cases such as social media, e-commerce, and big data analytics.

### Weaknesses of NoSQL Databases:
1. Lack of standardized query language: each type of NoSQL database has its own method for querying data, which can make these systems more challenging to learn, integrate, and communicate with.

2. Not well-suited for complex transactions or querying relationships between data.

### Common Use Cases:
1. Social media platforms employ NoSQL databases to store and manage user-generated content, facilitating efficient storage and processing of diverse content types.

2. In e-commerce, NoSQL databases are crucial for handling product recommendations and customer analytics, enabling personalized recommendations and improved customer experiences.

3. NoSQL databases excel in big data analytics, handling high-velocity and high-volume data streams and extracting valuable insights from rapidly changing data sources.

### When should I use a NoSQL database over a relational database?
A NoSQL database is a better choice than a relational database when you’re dealing with large amounts of unstructured, semi-structured or rapidly changing data that does not neatly fit into rows and columns.

NoSQL databases excel in use cases requiring high scalability, horizontal distribution across nodes, and low-latency performance, such as real-time analytics, content management, and IoT applications. They are particularly suited for scenarios involving schema flexibility, like storing JSON documents or graph-based data, or when working with key-value pairs for caching and session management.

Additionally, NoSQL is better suited to scenarios where eventual consistency is acceptable over strict ACID compliance, enabling high throughput for systems handling massive, distributed workloads, such as social media platforms or recommendation engines.



Relational vs NoSQL Databases
SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are fundamentally different in how they are designed, how they store data, and how they are used.
SQL databases use a structured, tabular schema, adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties, and are optimized for complex queries and relationships, but they typically scale vertically, which can have limitations and higher costs.
NoSQL databases offer flexibility with a schema-less structure and various data types, scale horizontally for handling large data volumes, and provide simpler query languages, but they may sacrifice ACID compliance for performance and are not uniformly designed for handling complex relationships.
However, these distinctions are not always clear-cut, and the choice of database ultimately depends on your specific use case and requirements.

| Scenario                              | When to Use NoSQL                                                                                       | When to Use Relational Databases                                                      |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Handling large-scale, unstructured data | NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Cassandra are ideal for managing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON files or multimedia. | Relational databases struggle with unstructured data due to rigid schemas.            |
| Dynamic or evolving data models        | Use NoSQL when your data model changes frequently or requires flexible schema definitions.              | Relational databases are better when the data model is stable and well-defined.       |
| Real-time analytics or high-velocity data | NoSQL is suited for real-time processing in applications like IoT, social media, or e-commerce analytics. | Relational databases may lag in high-velocity scenarios due to strict ACID compliance. |
| Complex relationships and joins        | Avoid NoSQL if your application relies heavily on joins or complex relationships; graph databases are an exception. | Relational databases excel at managing complex relationships with structured data and foreign keys. |
| Horizontal scalability requirements    | NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling across multiple servers, making them ideal for distributed systems. | Relational databases typically scale vertically, which can become expensive and less efficient. |
| Strict transactional integrity (ACID)  | NoSQL databases often trade strict consistency for scalability, suitable for eventual consistency models. | Use relational databases for applications like banking or financial systems that require ACID properties. |
| Support for multi-model use cases      | NoSQL databases offer multi-model support, such as combining document, key-value, and graph models.     | Relational databases are less flexible for multi-model use cases.                     |
| Data archival or simple read operations | NoSQL databases like key-value stores are better for caching or systems with high-read, low-write requirements. | Relational databases are overkill for simple key-value or archival needs.             |
| Applications requiring complex querying | NoSQL may fall short due to limited or specialized query capabilities.                                  | Relational databases are ideal for complex queries requiring SQL, joins, and aggregations. |
| Short development cycles               | NoSQL supports rapid development and iteration due to its flexible schema and scalability.              | Relational databases require upfront schema design, slowing development in dynamic environments. |
| System handling structured, tabular data | Not ideal unless specific use cases demand alternative models.                                           | Relational databases are the best choice for structured, tabular data with predictable relationships. |

# 🌐 REST Architecture Overview

**REST** stands for **REpresentational State Transfer**.  
It is an **architectural style** for distributed hypermedia systems, first introduced by **Roy Fielding in 2000** in his dissertation.  

Since then, it has become one of the most widely adopted approaches for building **web-based APIs**.  

⚡ **Key Points**:
- REST is **not a protocol or standard**, but an **architectural style**.  
- REST APIs (or RESTful APIs) must follow certain **guiding principles** (constraints).  
- These principles ensure **simplicity, scalability, and statelessness** in system design.  

---

## 📜 The Six Guiding Principles of REST

1. **Client–Server Architecture**  
   - Separation of concerns: the client handles the **front-end/UI**, while the server manages the **data and logic**.  
   - Promotes **independent development** and **scalability**.  

2. **Statelessness**  
   - Each client request must contain **all the information** needed to process it.  
   - The server does **not store client context** between requests.  

3. **Cacheability**  
   - Responses should be explicitly marked as **cacheable or non-cacheable**.  
   - Improves **performance** and **reduces server load**.  

4. **Uniform Interface**  
   - Resources are identified using **URIs** (e.g., `/users/1`).  
   - Standard methods (HTTP verbs like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) are used consistently.  
   - Ensures **simplicity** and **decoupling** between client and server.  

5. **Layered System**  
   - A client cannot ordinarily tell if it is connected directly to the **end server** or an **intermediary** (like a proxy or load balancer).  
   - Promotes **scalability via load balancing** and **security via gateways**.  

6. **Code on Demand (Optional)**  
   - Servers can extend client functionality by **transferring executable code** (e.g., JavaScript).  
   - This principle is optional but adds **flexibility**.

✅ A web API (or web service) that adheres to these principles is called a **REST API** (or **RESTful API**). 
``` 

                +-------------------+
                |      Client       |
                | (Browser, App)    |
                +---------+---------+
                          |
                          | HTTP Request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
                          v
                +---------+---------+
                |      REST API     |
                |   (Web Server)    |

 +-------------+    +-------------+     +-------------+
        |                  |                   |
        ----------------------------------------
                          |
                          v
                +---------+---------+
                |    Response       |
                | (JSON / XML)      |
                +-------------------+
```

This shows:

- The client sends an HTTP request.
- The REST API server receives it.
- The server accesses the appropriate resource (/users, /products, /orders).
- The server sends back a response (commonly JSON or XML).
